      <description>This is my documentation about the process of flashing and tweaking coreboot to run properly on my T440p with a dedicated NVIDIA GPU, colloquially known as a &amp;lsquo;dGPU&amp;rsquo;. There are multiple guides that will teach you how to build, flash, or build and flash coreboot on a T440p without issue. However, if you have a T440p with a dGPU, you will quickly realize that the GPU is mysteriously absent from your PCI device list.</description>

      <description>Hey. I&amp;rsquo;m Cameron. I&amp;rsquo;m a network admin for a small cellular company in NZ. I like hiking, music production, video games and the free and open-source software movements. I like other stuff, but I forgot tbh. I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you later if I remember.
This is a blog I felt compelled to create as I dive further into open-source. I keep a lot of scattered notes on my own setups that benefit me when I need them.</description>
